'''
This bot is meant to search /r/YasuoMains or Matchup thread in that subreddit
for the champion the user typed in then print the comment(or link it?). In the
future it will be able to seach a site (try op.gg) and display the runes,
masteries, or builds if asked with the highest win rate. Maybe later have an
option to search the subreddit for tips or op.gg for builds and things so the
bot doesn't do both if the user only wants one of the two.
